[![pipeline status](https://gitlab.com/l3p-cv/lost/badges/master/pipeline.svg)](https://gitlab.com/l3p-cv/lost/pipelines)
[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/lost/badge/?version=latest)](https://lost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)

## Description

LOST (Label Object and Save Time) is a **flexible** **web-based** framework
for **simple collaborative** image annotation.
It provides multiple annotation interfaces for fast image annotation.

LOST offers a set of **out of the box annotation pipelines** to instantly annotate images without programming knowledge.

Nevertheless LOST is **flexible** since it allows to run user defined annotation
pipelines where different
annotation interfaces/ tools and algorithms can be combined in one process.

The application is highly scalable and offers, for example, easy-to-set-up connectivity to **external file systems**, such as S3 Bucket or Azure Blobstorage via the user interface.

It is **web-based** since the whole annotation process is visualized in
your browser.
You can quickly setup LOST with docker on your local machine or run it
on a web server to make an annotation process available to your
annotators around the world.
LOST allows to organize label trees, to monitor the state of an
annotation process and to do annotations inside the browser.

LOST was especially designed to model **semi-automatic** annotation
pipelines to speed up the annotation process.
Such a semi-automatic can be achieved by using AI generated annotation
proposals that are presented to an annotator inside the annotation tool.

### Key Features

- :earth_americas: Collaborative annotation - distribute your annotation tasks around  the world
- :rocket: Out of the box annotation pipelines
  - Annotate bboxes, polygons, points or lines with the Single Image Annotation Tool (SIA)
  - Annotate whole image clusters with the Multi Image Annotation Tool (MIA)
  - Export your datasets
- :open_file_folder: Connect external file systems, such as AWS S3 bucket, MS Azure blobstorage or FTP server
- :inbox_tray: Instant annotation export allows you to access all annotations at any time
- :chart_with_upwards_trend: Personal and project based annotation statistics
- :label: Organize your labels with colored label trees

## Getting Started

### Documentation

A lot of new features have been added and improvements have been made compared to version 1 (see [Changelog](./CHANGELOG.md)).
The adaptation of the documentation is currently still in progress.

    [https://docs.docker.com/install/](https://docs.docker.com/install/)
2. Clone LOST:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/l3p-cv/lost.git
    ```

3. Install the *cryptography* package in your python environment:

    ```bash
    pip install cryptography
    ```

4. Run quick_setup script:

    ```bash
    python3 quick_setup.py /path/to/install/lost --release 3.0.0-alpha.2
    ```

5. Run LOST:  
    Follow instructions of the quick_setup script, printed in the command line.

## Projects using LOST

- PlantVillage @ Pennsylvania State University is using LOST to build [a tool that is positively impacting millions of lives in Kenya with the Desert Locust Crisis](https://news.psu.edu/story/609265/2020/02/21/research/penn-state-responds-app-aids-un-efforts-control-africas-locust). See this [blog article](https://plantvillage.psu.edu/blogposts/97-getting-lost-can-be-good) by Annalyse Kehs to get more information how LOST is utilized in the project.
