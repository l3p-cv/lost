# All about pipelines

## Pipeline Projects {#aapipelines-pipe-projects}

A pipeline project in LOST is defined as a folder or git repository that
contains pipeline definition files in json format and related python3
scripts. Additional, other files can be placed into this folder that can
be accessed by the scripts of a pipeline.

### Pipeline Project Examples

Pipeline project examples can be found here: [LOST Out of the Box
Pipelines](https://github.com/l3p-cv/lost_ootb_pipes)

### Repository Structure

@TODO
pp_repo_structure.txt

The `listing above <pp-dir-structure>`
shows an example for a pipeline directory structure. Where the root
folder **lost_ootb_pipes** is the repo name and **found** is the name of
the pipeline project. **found** contains all files required for the
pipelines of the pipeline project. Within the project there are json
files where each represents a pipeline definition. A pipeline is
composed from different scripts (**request_annos.py**,
**request_annos_again.py**, **request_images.\_by_lbl.py**) and other
pipeline elements. Some of the scripts may require a special python
package you have written. So if you want to use this package (e.g.
**my_special_python_lib**), just place it also inside the pipeline
project folder. Sometimes it is also useful to place some files into the
project folder, for example a pretrained ai model that should be loaded
inside a script.

### Importing a Pipeline Project into LOST {#aapipelines-import}

After creating a pipeline it needs to be imported into LOST. In order to
do that, you need to perform the following steps:

1. Log into LOST as Admin
2. Go to Admin Area
3. Click on the Pipeline Projects tab
4. Click on Import pipeline project button
5. Click on Import/ Update pipeline project from a public git
    repository
6. Add the url of the pipeline project you like to import
7. Click on Import/ Update

## Updating a LOST Pipeline

If there was an update for one of your pipelines you need to update your
pipe project in LOST.In order to do this, the procedure is the same as
for `importing a pipeline <aapipelines-import>`

## Namespacing

When importing or updating a pipeline project in LOST the following
namespacing will be applied to pipelines: **\<name of pipeline project
folder\>.\<name of pipeline json file\>**. In the same way scripts will
be namespaced internally by LOST: **\<name of pipeline project
folder\>.\<name of python script file\>**.

So in `our example <pp-dir-structure>` the
pipelines would be named **found.mia** and **found.mia_request_again**
\....

#### Pipeline Definition Files {#aapipelines-pipe-def-files}

Within the **pipeline definition file** you define your annotation
process. Such a pipeline is composed of different standard elements that
are supported by LOST like **datasource**, **script**, **annotTask**,
**dataExport**, **visualOutput** and **loop**. Each pipeline element is
represented by a json object inside the pipeline definition.

As you can see in the `example <aapipelines-example>`, the pipeline itself is also defined by a json object. This
object has a *description*, a *author*, a *pipe-schema-version* and a
list of pipeline *elements*. Each element object has a *peN* (*pipeline
element number*) which is the identifier of the element itself. An
element needs also an attribute that is called *peOut* and contains a
list of elements where the current element is connected to.

## An Example

## Possible Pipeline Elements

Below you will find the definition of all possible pipeline elements in
LOST.

##### Datasource Element

``` {.json linenos="" emphasize-lines="4-6"}
{
  "peN" : "[int]",
  "peOut" : "[list of int]|[null]",
  "datasource" : {
    "type" : "rawFile"
  }
}
```

**Datasource** elements are intended to provide datasets to **Script**
elements. To be more specific it will provide a path inside the LOST
system. In most cases this will be a path to a folder with images that
should be annotated. The listing above shows the definition of a
**Datasource** element. At the current state only type **rawFile** is
supported, which will provide a path.

##### Script Element

``` {.json linenos="" emphasize-lines="4-7"}
{
  "peN" : "[int]",
  "peOut" : "[list of int]|[null]",
  "script" : {
    "path": "[string]",
    "description" : "[string]"
  }
}
```

**Script** elements represent python3 scripts that are executed as part
of your pipeline. In order to define a **Script** you need to specify a
**path** to the script file relative to the
`pipeline project folder <aapipelines-pipe-projects>` and a short **description** of your script.

##### AnnoTask Element

``` {.json linenos="" emphasize-lines="4-8

{
  \"peN\" : \"[int]\",
  \"peOut\" : \"[list of int]|[null]\",
  \"annoTask\" : {
    \"type\" : \"mia|sia\",
    \"name\" : \"[string]\",
    \"instructions\" : \"[string]\",
    \"configuration\":{\"...\"}
  }
}"}
```

An **AnnoTask** represents an annotation task for a human-in-the-loop.
**Scripts** can request annotations for specific images that will be
presented in one of the annotation tools in the web gui.

Right now two types of annotation tools are available. If you set
**type** to **sia** the
`single image annotation tool <annotators-sia>` will be used for annotation. When choosing **mia** the
images will be present in the
`multi image annotation tool <annotators-mia>`.

An **AnnoTask** requires also a **name** and **instructions** for the
annotator. Based on the **type** a specific configuration is required.

If **\"type\"** is **\"mia\"** the configuration will be the following:

``` {.json linenos=""}
{
  "type": "annoBased|imageBased",
  "showProposedLabel": "[boolean]",
  "drawAnno": "[boolean]",
  "addContext": "[float]"
}
```

MIA configuration:

:   -

        **type**

        :   -   If **imageBased** a whole image will be presented in the
                clustered view.
            -   If **annoBased** all
                `lost.db.model.TwoDAnno` objects related to an image will be
                cropped and presented in the clustered view.

    -   

        **showProposedLabel**

        :   -   If **true**, the assigned sim_class will be interpreted
                as label and be used as pre-selection of the label in
                the MIA tool.

    -   

        **drawAnno**

        :   -   If **true** and **type : annoBased** the specific
                annotation will be drawn inside the cropped image.

    -   

        **addContext**

        :   -   If **type : annoBased** and **addContext \> 0.0**, some
                amount of pixels will be added around the annotation
                when the annotation is cropped. The number of pixels
                that are add is calculated relative to the image size.
                So if you set **addContext** to **0.1**, 10 percent of
                the image size will be added to the crop. This setting
                is useful to provide the annotator some more visual
                context during the annotation step.

If **\"type\"** is **\"sia\"** the configuration will be the following:

``` {.json linenos=""}
{
  "tools": {
          "point": "[boolean]",
          "line": "[boolean]",
          "polygon": "[boolean]",
          "bbox": "[boolean]",
          "junk": "[boolean]"
  },
  "annos":{
      "multilabels": "[boolean]",
      "actions": {
          "draw": "[boolean]",
          "label": "[boolean]",
          "edit": "[boolean]",
      },
      "minArea": "[int]",
      "maxAnnos": "[int or null]"
  },
  "img": {
      "multilabels": "[boolean]",
      "actions": {
          "label": "[boolean]",
      }
  }
}
```

SIA configuration:

:   -

        **tools**

        :   -   Inside the **tools** object you can select which drawing
                tools are available and if the junk button is present in
                the SIA gui. You may choose either **true** or **false**
                for each of the tools (**point, line, polygon, bbox,
                junk**).

    -   

        **annos** (configuration for annotations on the image)

        :   -   

                **actions**

                :   -   **draw** is set to **false** a user may not draw
                        any new annotations. This is useful if a script
                        sent annotation proposals to SIA and the user
                        should only correct the proposed annotations.
                    -   **label** allows to disable the possibility to
                        assign labels to annotations. This option is
                        useful if you wish that your annotator will only
                        draw annotations.
                    -   **edit** inidcates wether an annotator may edit
                        an annotation that is already present.

            -   **multilabels** allows to assign multiple labels per
                annotation.

            -   **minArea** The minimum area in pixels that an
                annotation may have. This constraint is only applied to
                annotations where an area can be defined (e.g. BBoxs,
                Polygons).

            -   **maxAnnos** Maximum number of annos that are allowed
                per image. If null an infinite number of annotation are
                allowed per image.

    -   

        **img** (configuration for the image)

        :   -   

                **actions**

                :   -   **label** allows to disable the possibility to
                        assign labels to the image.

            -   **multilabels** allows to assign multiple labels to the
                image.

##### DataExport

``` {.json linenos="" emphasize-lines="4"}
{
  "peN" : "[int]",
  "peOut" : "[list of int]|[null]",
  "dataExport" : {}
}
```

A **DataExport** is used to serve a file generated by a script in the
web gui. No special configuration is required for this pipeline element.
The file to download will be provided by a **Script** that is connected
to the input of the **DataExport** element. This **Script** will call
the `lost.pyapi.inout.ScriptOutput.add_data_export` method in order to do that.

#### VisualOutput

``` {.json linenos="" emphasize-lines="4"}
{
  "peN" : "[int]",
  "peOut" : "[list of int]|[null]",
  "visualOutput" : {}
}
```

A **VisualOutput** element can display images and html text inside the
LOST web gui. A connected **Script** element will provide the content to
an **VisualOutput** by calling
`lost.pyapi.inout.ScriptOutput.add_visual_output`.

##### Loop

``` {.json linenos="" emphasize-lines="4-7"}
{
  "peN": "[int]",
  "peOut": "[list of int]|[null]",
  "loop": {
    "maxIteration": "[int]|[null]",
    "peJumpId": "[int]"
  }
}
```

A **Loop** element can be used to build learning loops inside of a
pipeline. Such a **Loop** models a similar behaviour to a *while* loop
in a programming language.

The **peJumpId** defines the **peN** of another element in the pipeline
where this **Loop** should jump to while looping. The **maxIteration**
setting inside a loop definition can be set to a **maximum amount of
iterations** that should be performed or to **null** in order to have an
infinity loop.

A **Script** element inside a loop cycle may break a loop by calling
`lost.pyapi.script.Script.break_loop`.
**Scripts** inside a loop cycle may check if a loop was broken by
calling `lost.pyapi.script.Script.loop_is_broken`.
