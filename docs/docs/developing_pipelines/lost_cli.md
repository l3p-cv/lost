# LOST CLI

## Login to a Docker Container

In order to use the LOST command line interface, you need to login to a
lost docker container like this:

> ``` bash
> # Log in to the docker container.
> # If your user is not part of the docker group, 
> # you may need to use *sudo* 
> docker exec -it lost bash
> ```

## Managing Pipeline Projects

### Import Project

After creating a pipeline, it needs to be imported into LOST. In order to
do that, we need to copy the pipeline project folder into the
*lost_data_folder/my_data* in your/host file system e.g:

> ``` bash
> # Copy your pipe_project into the LOST data folder
> cp -r my_pipe_project path_to_lost_data/my_data/ 
> ```

Every file that is located under *lost_data_folder* will be visible
inside the lost docker container.

Now we will login to the container with:

> ``` bash
> # Log in to the docker container.
> # If your user is not part of the docker group, 
> # you may need to use *sudo* 
> docker exec -it lost bash
> ```

After a successful login we can start the pipeline import. For this
import, we will use the lost command line tools. To import a pipeline
project we use a program called *import_pipe_project.py*. This program
expects the path to the *pipeline project* as argument.

If you copied your *pipeline project* to
*/home/my_user/lost/data/my_data/my_pipe_project* on the host machine,
it will be available inside the container under
*/home/lost/my_data/my_pipe_project*.

:::note[Note]

It is just a convention to place your pipelines, that should be imported,
into the **my_data** folder. Theoretically, you could place your **pipeline
projects** anywhere in the *lost_data_folder*, but life is easier when
following this convention.
:::

Let's do the import:

> ``` bash
> # Import my_pipe_project into LOST
> import_pipe_project.py /home/lost/my_data/my_pipe_project
> ```

The **import_pipe_project.py** program will copy your pipeline project
folder into the folder */home/lost/data/pipes* and write all the meta
information into the lost database. After this import, the pipeline
should be visible in the web gui when clicking on the *Start Pipeline*
button in the *Designer* view.

### Update Project

To update a pipe project you need to perform the same steps as above
for the import, with the sole difference being that you need to call the
**update_pipe_project.py** program:

> ``` bash
> # Update my_pipe_project in LOST
> update_pipe_project.py /home/lost/my_data/my_pipe_project
> ```

### Remove Project

If you want to remove a pipeline project from you lost instance, you can
use the **remove_pipe_project.py** script. After logging into the
container, perform:

``` bash
# Remove my_pipe_project from a LOST instance
remove_pipe_project.py /home/lost/my_data/my_pipe_project
```

:::note[Note]
You can only remove pipelines that are not already in use, since your data
would get inconsistent otherwise. If you'd like to remove a pipeline that
was already instantiated, you need to delete all instances of this pipeline
first.

## Managing Label Trees

Sets of labels are managed in label trees. See Figure 1 below for an example.
The LOST command line tools support the **import** of a label tree from
a csv file, the **export** of a label tree to a csv file and to
**remove** a label tree by its name.

![labeltree](/img/label_tree_example.png)  
Figure 1: An example label tree. As it is visualized in the web gui.

### Import Label Tree

Before you can import a labeltree, you need to define it in a csv file.
See Figure 2 below for an example of such a tree definition. For more
examples navigate to
[lost/backend/lost/pyapi/examples/label_trees](https://github.com/l3p-cv/lost/tree/master/backend/lost/pyapi/examples/label_trees)
in our GitHub repository. Each **leaf** in a tree represents a label,
while the **root** is the tree name and can not be selected as label
during an annotation process.

![labeltree](/img/labeltree_csv.png)  
Figure 2: CSV representation of the example label tree in Figure 1.

When you have created your own **label tree** (let's assume you defined
it in *my_labeltree.csv*), you need to copy it to
*lost_data_folder/my_data/*:

``` bash
# Copy your labeltree definition the LOST data folder
cp  my_labeltree.csv path_to_lost_data/my_data/
```

Now your csv file can be accessed from inside of the docker container.
In order to import your label tree, we will login to the container and
call **import_label_tree.py**:

``` bash
# Login to the lost docker container
docker exec -it lost bash

# Import the label tree from your csv file
import_label_tree.py /home/lost/my_data/my_labeltree.csv
```

The label tree should now be visible in the web gui.

### Export Label Tree

If you'd like to export a label tree that you have created with the lost
web gui to a csv file you can use **export_label_tree.py**.

For now, we will assume that we want to export the tree presented in
Figure 1. Its name is **dummy tree** (name of the root node) an we want
to export it to a file called **exported_tree.csv**. To do that we need
to perform the following steps:

``` bash
# Login to the lost docker container
docker exec -it lost bash

# Export a label tree to a csv file
export_label_tree.py "dummy tree" /home/lost/my_data/exported_tree.csv
```

In the host machine the **exported_tree.csv** will now be visible at
*lost_data_folder/my_data/exported_tree.csv*.

### Remove Label Tree

You can remove a label tree from LOST by calling
**remove_label_tree.py** inside the lost docker container. A label tree
can be identified by its name. So if you like to remove our example tree
from Figure 1 with name **dummy tree**, you need to perform the
following steps:

``` bash
# Login to the lost docker container
docker exec -it lost bash

# Remove a label tree by name
remove_label_tree.py --name "dummy tree"
```

:::note[Note]
A label tree can only be removed by the cli, if no label in this tree is
used by a pipeline instance in LOST.
