# Admin Area

The admin area consists of several tabs filled with datatables,
with which an admin can manage key areas of the LOST instance.

All currently available Tabs are:

- Users & Groups
- Pipeline Projects
- Global Datasources
- Global Labels
- Global Instructions
- Workers
- Inference Models

## Users & Groups

### Management

Users and groups can be added via the \"Users\" section.
Then, users can be added to groups and be given roles, by
editing them.
