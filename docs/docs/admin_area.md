## Users & Groups

### Management

Users and groups can be added via the \"Users\" section. Each user
created gets its own default group with the same name as the username.
No more users can be added to this default group. Groups that are added
manually can be assigned to any number of users.

### Visibility

#### Pipelines

Pipelines can be assigned to a group or to the own user when starting.
Only groups to which the user is assigned to can be selected. Later, these
pipelines will only be visible to the selected group or user.

#### Label Trees

Label Trees are visible system-wide across all applications.

#### AnnoTasks

AnnoTasks can be assigned either to your own user or to a group when
configuring it while you are
starting a pipeline. Only groups to which the user is assigned to can be
selected.

#### Pipeline Templates

Pipeline Templates are visible system-wide across all applications.
