with which an admin can manage key areas of the LOST instance.

All currently available Tabs are:

- Users & Groups
- Pipeline Projects
- Global Datasources
- Global Labels
- Global Instructions

## Users & Groups

### Management

Users and groups can be added via the \"Users\" section.
Then, users can be added to groups and be given roles, by
editing them.

### Visibility

#### Pipelines

Pipelines are generally visible to the user who created them.

#### Label Trees

Label Trees are visible system-wide across all applications.

#### AnnoTasks

AnnoTasks can be assigned either to your own user or to a group when
configuring it while you are
starting a pipeline. Only groups to which the user is assigned to can be
selected.
