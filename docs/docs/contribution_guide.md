    feature/ fix the bug
3. We will respond to your comment
4. Implement the feature
5. Create a pull request

## How to do backend development?

The backend is written in python. We use flask as webserver and celery
to execute time consuming tasks.

If you want to adjust backend code and test your changes please perform
the following steps:

1. Install LOST as described in `LOST QuickSetup <quick-setup>`.
2. Adjust the *DEBUG* variable in the *.env* config file. This file
    should be located at *lost_install_dir/docker/.env*.

> ``` {.bash caption="Changes that need to be performed in the *.env* file. This will cause the LOST flask server to start in debug mode."}
> DEBUG=True
> ```

3. In oder to run your code, you need to mount your code into the
    docker container. You can do this by adding docker volumes in the
    *docker-compose.yml* file. The file should be located at
    *lost_install_dir/docker/docker-compose.yml*. Do this for all
    containers in the compose file that contain lost source code (lost,
    lost-cv, lost-cv-gpu)

> ``` {.yaml emphasize-lines="11" caption="Adjustments to *docker-compose.yml*. Mount your backend code into the docker container."}
> version: '2'
>   services:
>       lost:
>         image: l3pcv/lost:{LOST_VERSION}
>         container_name: lost
>         command: bash /entrypoint.sh
>         env_file:
>           - .env
>         volumes:
>           - {LOST_DATA}:/home/lost
>           - </path/to/lost_clone>/backend/lost:/code/src/backend/lost
> ```

Note
:::

Because flask is in debug mode, code changes are applied immediately. An
exception to this behaviour are changes to code that is related to
celery tasks. After such changes lost needs to be restarted manually to
get the code changes working.

# How to do frontend development?

The Frontend is developed with React, Redux, CoreUI

1. To start developing frontend follow the
    `LOST QuickSetup <quick-setup>` instruction.
2. Change directory to the frontend folder and install npm packages

> ``` bash
> cd lost/frontend/lost/
> npm i
> ```

3. \[Optional\] Set backend port in package.json start script with
    REACT_APP_PORT variable.
4. Start development server with

> ``` bash
> npm start
> ```

# Building lost containers locally

- The whole build process is described in
    [.gitlab-ci.yml](https://github.com/l3p-cv/lost/blob/master/.gitlab-ci.yml).

- All required docker files are provided in
    [lost/docker](https://github.com/l3p-cv/lost/tree/master/docker)
    within the lost repo.

-

    There are 3 lost container that will be executing scripts and the webserver

    :   -   *lost*: Will run the webserver and provide the basic
            environment where scripts can be executed.
        -   *lost-cv*: Will provide an computer vision environment in
            oder to execute scripts that require special libraries like
            opencv.
        -   *lost-cv-gpu*: Will provide gpu support for scripts that use
            libraries that need gpu support like tensorflow.

-

    Building the *lost* container

    :   -   The *lost* container will inherit from the *lost-base*.
        -   As first step build *lost-base*. The Dockerfile is located
            at
            [lost/docker/lost-base](https://github.com/l3p-cv/lost/blob/master/docker/lost-base/).
        -   After that you can build the *lost* container, using your
            local version of *lost-base*. The dockerfile can be found
            here:
            [lost/docker/lost](https://github.com/l3p-cv/lost/blob/master/docker/lost/)
