# Instructions

**Instructions**, as they are used here, are a way to
make the directives given to annotators simple and
reusable. When an **Annotator** opens an **AnnotationTask**,
the first thing they see is a pop-up containing the
**Instructions** selected when creating the **AnnotationTask**.

To create new **Instructions**, to to the **Instructions* tab
and, above the table, click on the *"Create Instruction"*
button. There you have to fill out three fields you can see
in Figure 2:

- Title
  - the name of the **Instruction**
- Description
  - a short description of the **Instruction**, one
  can see in the table
- Content
  - the actual instructions the **Annotator** sees

Futhermore, the right window will show how the content
is displayed for the user, as you can use markdown-
language there, to style and adapt the **Instructions**.
