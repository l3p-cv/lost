# Annotation Review

## SIA-Review-Tool For Designers {#sia-review}

As owner of a pipeline it is often required to have a quick look at the
current annotation progress or to correct single annotations of an
annotation task. For that purpose we implemented the SIA-Review tool. It
is available for users with the role designer and can be accessed via
the pipeline view, when clicking on the *Review Annotations* button.

Figure 1 show the detail popup of an annotation task in a pipeline. When
clicking on the *Review Annotations* button you will be redirected to
the **SIA Review Tool**. Figure 2 shows the review interface.

In contrast to the normal
`SIA Annotation Tool <annotators-sia>` you
need to explicitly click on the **SAVE button** in order to save
changes. When moving to the next image without saving, no changes will
be stored. Everything else will be similar to the
`SIA Annotation Tool <annotators-sia>`.
The review tool can be used to review all types of annotation tasks (SIA
and MIA)
