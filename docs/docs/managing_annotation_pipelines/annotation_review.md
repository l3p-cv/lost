# Annotation Review

## SIA-Review-Tool For Designers {#sia-review}

As owner of a pipeline and / or manager of datasets it is often
required to have a quick look at the
current annotation progress or to correct single annotations of an
annotation task. For this purpose we implemented the SIA-Review tool. It
is available for users with the role designer and can be accessed via
the pipeline view, when clicking on the *Review Annotations* button.

### Filtering in Review

To make reviewing easier, images can be filtered by name and label.

When filtering according to labels, only images containing the given
labels will be shown and switching between images will only lead
to the ones fulfilling this criteria. To exit this mode,
click the new button, #TODO, which is now displayed above the
SIA-tool.
