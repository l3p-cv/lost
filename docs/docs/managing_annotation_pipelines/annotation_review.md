# Annotation Review

## SIA-Review-Tool For Designers {#sia-review}

As a manager of datasets, it is often
required to have a quick look at the
current annotation progress or to correct single annotations of an
annotation task. For this purpose, we implemented the SIA-Review tool. It
is available for users with the role designer and can be accessed via
the **Datasets** table, when clicking on the *Review Dataset* button.
This way, you can review a single annotation task or all of them,
that are bundled in a specific **Dataset**.

Figure 1 shows the detail popup of an annotation task in a pipeline. When
clicking on the *Review Dataset* button you will be redirected to
the **SIA Review Tool**. Figure 2 shows the review interface in action.

The review tool can be used to review all types of annotation tasks (SIA
and MIA)

### Filtering in Review

To make reviewing easier, images can be filtered by name and label.

When filtering according to labels, only images containing the given
labels will be shown and switching between images will only lead
to the ones fulfilling this criteria. To exit this mode,
click the new button, which is now displayed above the
SIA-tool.
