# Configuration

## E-Mail Notifications

In order to activate E-Mail Notifications you have to provide an
outgoing E-Mail Account. In your `.env` file you have to add the
following environment variables. If you have set up lost with the quick
setup script, these variables only need to be "commented in" and
adjusted:

> ``` bash
> LOST_MAIL_ACTIVE=True
> LOST_MAIL_SERVER=mailserver.com
> LOST_MAIL_PORT=465
> LOST_MAIL_USE_SSL=True
> LOST_MAIL_USE_TLS=True
> LOST_MAIL_USERNAME=email@email.com
> LOST_MAIL_PASSWORD=password
> LOST_MAIL_DEFAULT_SENDER=LOST Notification System <email@email.com>
> LOST_MAIL_LOST_URL=http://mylostinstance.url/
> ```

## LDAP

LDAP can be configured using the following environment variables in your
`.env` file:

> ``` bash
> LOST_LDAP_ACTIVE=True
> LOST_LDAP_HOST=192.168.0.100
> LOST_LDAP_PORT=389
> LOST_LDAP_BASE_DN=dc=example,dc=com
> LOST_LDAP_USER_DN=ou=myOrganizationUnit
> LOST_LDAP_BIND_USER_DN=cn=binduser,dc=example,dc=com
> LOST_LDAP_BIND_USER_PASSWORD=ldap_bind_password
> ```

For more LDAP configurations just check the Flask LDAP documentation:
[Flask LDAP
Documentation](https://flask-ldap3-login.readthedocs.io/en/latest/quick_start.html).

It is important that all LDAP environment variables are prefixed with "LOST" so that the settings are applied:

``` bash
    LOST_LDAP_GROUP_OBJECT_FILTER=(objectclass=posixGroup)
    LOST_LDAP_GROUP_DN=
    LOST_LDAP_USER_RDN_ATTR=cn
    LOST_LDAP_USER_LOGIN_ATTR=uid
    LOST_LDAP_USE_SSL=False
    LOST_LDAP_ADD_SERVER= True
```

:::note[Note]
Users logging into LOST for the first time using LDAP are automatically
assigned the **Annotator** role. If you want to assign another role to
the user, you have to do so in the user management in the Admin Area.
:::

:::note[Note]
The resolution of groups via LDAP is not yet supported. If a LOST group
should be assigned to an LDAP user, this must be done via the user
management in the Admin Area.
:::

:::warning[Warning]
If a local user with the same user name of a new LDAP user already
exists, the local user settings will be overwritten by those of the LDAP
user.

## JupyterLab

The JupyterLab integration is primarily intended for pipeline developers
and quick experiments in LOST. Through this integration, it is very easy
to access all pipelines and their elements at any time and to manipulate
them through a web interface. By accessing the LOST pyAPI, various
operations can be investigated, as they are also executed in the scripts
of the annotation pipelines.

In order to activate the JupyterLab Integration you have to add the
following environment variables in your `.env` file:

> ``` bash
> LOST_JUPYTER_LAB_ACTIVE=True
> LOST_JUPYTER_LAB_ROOT_PATH=/code/src
> LOST_JUPYTER_LAB_TOKEN=mysecrettoken
> LOST_JUPYTER_LAB_PORT=8888
> ```

In addition, the port for the JupyterLab must be enabled in the **lost**
service of your `docker-compose.yml` file:

> ``` bash
> ports:
>     - "${LOST_FRONTEND_PORT}:8080"
>     - "${LOST_JUPYTER_LAB_PORT:-8888}:8888"
> ```

Once the JupyterLab integration has been activated, the started
JupyterLab can be accessed via the GUI in the Admin Area. Within the
Admin Area, a new tab now appears that contains the link to the
JupyterLab.

## Git Access Token

With the help of the Git configuration, you can have your Git access
data (Personal Access Token) stored in the container. This means that,
for example, private Git repositories can be used within the JupyterLab
environment without having to enter a password. Furthermore, the
configuration of the Git settings is necessary so that private Git
repositories can be imported via the GUI.

In order to configure your Git authentication you have to add the
following environment variables in your `.env` file:

> ``` bash
> LOST_GIT_USER=Git User                                                                            │
> LOST_GIT_EMAIL=myemail                                                                      │
> LOST_GIT_ACCESS_TOKEN=https://mygitusername:mygitaccesstoken@github.com
> ```

## Nginx Configuration

### Configuration File

When starting the lost container, the corresponding nginx configuration
file (depending on debug mode) for nginx is copied from the repository
into the folder

> ``` bash
> /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf
> ```

by the **entrypoint.sh** script.

The two nginx configuration files (debug mode and production) can be found
at:
[lost/frontend/nginx.conf](https://github.com/l3p-cv/lost/blob/master/frontend/nginx.conf)
and [lost/setup/nginx.conf](https://github.com/l3p-cv/lost/blob/master/setup/nginx.conf)
in our GitHub repository.

### Custom Configuration File

If a custom configuration file is desired, that file must be mounted
from the host machine into the lost container.

> ``` yaml
> volumes:
>     - /host/path/to/nginx/conf:/etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf
> ```

:::note[Note]
By default, files with a **maximum size of 1GB** can be uploaded in
LOST. To change the maximum size you have to change the value
`client_max_body_size 1024M;` inside the nginx configuration file. In
addition, the environment variable `LOST_MAX_FILE_UPLOAD_SIZE` must also
be adjusted in the LOST configuration.
